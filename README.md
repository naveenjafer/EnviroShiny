# EnviroShiny
A Shiny app for analyzing Time series of a few parameters of a EnvirCar track. 

The app can be tried online here https://naveenjafer.shinyapps.io/EnviroCarShiny/ 
Please wait for a while as the page loads as the track has a lot of dimensions that have to be retrieved.

The api data from here https://envirocar.org/api/stable/tracks/56df1b11e4b0b5e237bca4a7 has been used to retrieve that data.
